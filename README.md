# PDF Summarizer

The PDF Summarizer is a web application built with Flask that allows users to upload a PDF file and generate a concise summary of its content. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text, compute TF-IDF scores, and extract the most important sentences for the summary. The frontend is designed with a modern, responsive UI and includes a typing animation for the generated summary.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files directly through the web interface.
- **Text Summarization**: The application extracts text from the PDF and generates a summary using TF-IDF-based sentence scoring.
- **Typing Animation**: The summary is displayed with a simulated typing effect for a better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator with an animated cursor is shown while the PDF is being processed.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - PyPDF (for extracting text from PDFs)
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing)
  - Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF vectorization)

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Modern UI design with responsive layout
  - Typing animation for summary display

## Customization

- **Summary Length**: Modify the `top_n` parameter in the `generate_summary` function in `app.py` to change the number of sentences in the summary.
- **Styling**: Update the CSS in `templates/index.html` to customize the appearance of the application.
- **File Upload Location**: Change the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` path in `app.py` to store uploaded files in a different directory.
